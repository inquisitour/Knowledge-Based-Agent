High blood sugar damages retinal blood vessels. That causes vision loss. Do you have high blood pressure or kidney problems? Ask your doctor about ways to manage and treat these problems. See your ophthalmologist regularly for dilated eye exams. Diabetic retinopathy may be found before you even notice any vision problems. If you notice vision changes in one or both eyes, call your ophthalmologist right away. Get treatment for diabetic retinopathy as soon as possible. This is the best way to prevent vision loss.",
