** The current application loop **

1. Saving question-answer pairs as a post processing operation.
2. Generating a data hash to check the data changes.
3. During the next initialization, store question-answer pairs along with their embeddings in PostgreSQL.
4. Utilize the 'category' column to construct a knowledge graph and store embeddings in Neo4j.
5. Employing a combination of PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and user queries to generate a response.
6. Iteratively repeat the process leveraging text embeddings, graph embeddings, and user queries to derive a relevant response.


text embeddings + graph embeddings + user query = common embeddings ?
