"questions","answers"
"What should I eat to ensure good vision?","Vitamins A, C, and E are all good for eye health. These vitamins have antioxidant properties that may decrease the risk of macular degeneration or AMD</br>A varied, balanced diet, rich in fruits and vegetables is recommended. Good sources of vitamins A, C, and E include: broccoli,oranges, papaya, sweet potato,</br>spinach, carrots, red peppers, pumpkin, almonds, peanut butter, sunflower seeds.</br>Studies also suggest omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, play a role in eye health and reduce the risk of age-related eye disease. Foods rich in omega-3s include fish, nuts, seeds, and beans. Carotenoids are present in the retina and may help to limit oxidative damage.</br></br>Green, leafy vegetables are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, but a person can also take them in supplement form. A range of dietary supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin are also available. A healthy balanced diet also delays the onset of Cataract."
"Does smoking affect my eye or vision?","Studies show smoking increases the risk of age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy and dry eye syndrome.</br></br>Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD): Smokers are three to four times more likely to develop AMD than nonsmokers. </br>Cataract: Heavy smokers have up to three times the risk of cataract as nonsmokers.</br>Glaucoma: There is a strong link between smoking and high blood pressure, cataracts and diabetes all of which are risk factors for glaucoma.</br>Diabetic Retinopathy: Smoking can increase the chances of getting diabetes. It can also make managing diabetes more difficult for those who already have it. Complications of diabetes made worse by smoking include retinopathy, heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, foot problems and many others.</br>Dry Eye Syndrome: Dry Eye Syndrome is more than twice as likely to impact smokers as non-smokers."
"Does Alcohol affect my eye or vision?","You may experience temporary effects like dizziness and blurred vision. If you are heavy or often drinker, you are at much higher risk for short term and permanent damages. </br></br>Short term effects</br>Dryness â‚¬â€œ little amount of alcohol can intensify dry eyes</br></br>Damaged Contrast â‚¬â€œ Too much alcohol can impair ability to make distinctions between different objects </br>Migraines â‚¬â€œ Possibly accompanied by sensitivity to light and other related vision problem, migraines can be caused by drinking too much.</br>Rapid Eye Movement â‚¬â€œ , it increases non-REM sleep and decreases REM sleep.</br>Long term effects</br>Optic neuropathy â‚¬â€œ It can cause loss of vision. </br>Vitamin Deficiency - can affect the livers intake of vitamins.</br></br>Cataract Formation â‚¬â€œ There is an increased cataract formation chances.</br>Age-Related Macular Degeneration â‚¬â€œ Heavy drinking could cause oxidative damage to the retina, potentially leading to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).</br>"
"Do Eye exercices really help ?","There is no irrefutable evidence that eye exercises can affect uncorrected visual acuity (sharpness of vision). Eye exercises may be of benefit for some eye misalignment or squint conditions. Discuss your questions about eye exercises with your ophthalmologist."
"How do instill eye drops?","Follow these steps to make it easier to put in eye drops:</br>Preparing the Drops</br>Always wash your hands before handling your eye drops or touching your eyes.</br>If youre wearing contact lenses, take them out â‚¬â€ unless your ophthalmologist has told you to leave them in.</br>Shake the drops vigorously before using them.</br>Remove the cap of the eye drop medication.</br>Do not touch the dropper tip.</br>Putting in Eye Drops</br>Tilt your head back slightly and look up. Some people find it helpful to focus on a specific point on the ceiling.</br>Use one hand to pull your lower eyelid down, away from the eye. This forms a pocket to catch the drop.</br>Hold the dropper tip directly over the eyelid pocket.</br>Squeeze the bottle gently and let the eye drop fall into the pocket.</br>Dont touch the bottle to your eye or eyelid. This can give bacteria or other contaminants a chance to grow in your eye drops.</br>After Youve Put in Eye Drops:</br>Close your eyes and do not blink.</br>Apply gentle pressure to your tear ducts, where the eyelid meets the nose.</br>Hold the tear ducts closed for a minute or twoâ‚¬â€or as long as your ophthalmologist recommendsâ‚¬â€before opening your eyes. This gives the drop time to be absorbed by the eye, instead of draining into your nose.</br>Wipe any unabsorbed drops from your closed lids with a tissue.</br>Repeat the same procedure with the other eye, if necessary.</br>Wash your hands after handling medication and touching your face.</br>If you need to take more than one type of eye drop at the same time, wait three to five minutes between the different kinds of medication.</br>Use your drops exactly when and how your doctor tells you to.</br>Ask your ophthalmologist or pharmacist if its OK to keep the drops in the refrigerator. When the drops are cold it might be easier to feel the drop when it hits the eye, so you can tell where it has landed.</br>If you have a lot of trouble putting in your eye drops, ask a caregiver or family member to help.</br>"
"What are the risks of Contact Lens ?","</br>Contact lenses that are old or that do not fit well can scratch your eye. They can also cause blood vessels to grow into your cornea, a dangerous condition that threatens your vision.</br></br>Eye drops can cause problems with your contact lenses. It is best to avoid using any kind of eye drop when wearing contacts. However, you can use wetting drops or preservative-free lubricating drops as recommended by your eye doctor.</br></br>Remove your contact lenses and call your eye doctor right away if your eyes are very red, painful, watery or sensitive to light. Do the same if you have blurry vision or notice discharge (ooze or pus) coming from your eye. These can be symptoms of serious eye problems."
"How do you take care of your Contact Lenses?","You must clean and disinfect any contact lens you remove from your eye before you put the lens back in. There are many types of cleansing systems. The choice depends on the type of lens you use, if you have allergies or if your eyes tend to form protein deposits. Ask your eye doctor what kind of cleaning solutions you should use.</br></br>Take special care to clean and store your lenses correctly to avoid dangerous eye infections.</br></br>Here is what you should do:</br></br>Follow the schedule your eye doctor gives you for wearing and replacing your lenses. You should not wear daily wear lenses while you sleep.</br>Remove contact lenses before taking a shower, using a hot tub, swimming, or doing anything where water gets in your eyes.</br>Before touching your contact lenses, wash your hands with soap and water and dry them with a lint-free towel.</br>Never put contacts in your mouth to wet them. Saliva (spit) is not a sterile solution.</br>Do not rinse or store contacts in water (tap or sterile water). Also, never use a homemade saline solution.</br>Do not use saline solution or rewetting drops to disinfect your lenses. They are not disinfectants.</br>Follow directions from your doctor and from the lens cleaning solution manufacturer to clean and store your lenses.</br>No matter what type of lens cleaning solution you buy, use a rub and rinse cleaning method. Rub your contact lenses with clean fingers, then rinse the lenses with solution before soaking them. Use this method even if the solution you are using is a no-rub type.</br>Use new solution each time you clean and disinfect your contact lenses. Never reuse or top off with old solution. Also, do not pour contact lens solution into a different bottle. The solution will no longer be sterile.</br>Make sure the tip of the solution bottle does not touch any surface. Keep the bottle tightly closed when you are not using it.</br>Rinse your contact lens case with sterile contact lens solution (not tap water). Then leave the empty case open to air dry.</br>Keep your contact lens case clean. Replace the case at least every 3 months, or right away if it gets cracked or damaged.</br>If you store your lenses in the case for a long time, check the contact lens instructions or the lens solution directions to see if you should re-disinfect them before wearing them. Never wear your contact lenses if they have been stored for 30 days or longer without re-disinfecting.</br>Contact lenses can warp over time, and your cornea can change shape. To make sure your lenses fit properly and the prescription is right for you, see your eye doctor regularly."
"Are contact lenses safe to use?","Millions of people choose to wear contact lenses. However, they are not for everyone. You might not be able to wear them for the following reasons:</br></br>You get a lot of eye infections.</br>You have severe allergies or dry eyes that are hard to treat.</br>You work or live where it is very dusty.</br>You are not able to properly care for your contact lenses.</br>Your cornea and tear film must be healthy for you to be comfortable and see clearly with contact lenses.</br></br>To safely wear contact lenses, you must be committed to caring for them properly and replacing them when needed. Talk with your ophthalmologist or other eye care professional to discuss your vision needs and expectations. They can help you decide if contacts are a good option for you."
"What is color blindness?","Color vision deficiency is the inability to distinguish certain shades of color. Very few people are completely color blind.</br></br>Color deficiency</br>Most people with color vision deficiency can see colors, but they have difficulty differentiating between the following colors:</br></br>People who are totally color blind (achromatopsia), can only see things as black and white or in shades of gray.</br></br>Color vision deficiency can range from mild to severe, depending on the cause. It affects both eyes if it is inherited and usually just one if it is caused by injury or illness.</br></br>Color vision is possible due to photoreceptors in the retina of the eye known as cones.  The most common form of color deficiency is red-green. These patients have a harder time differentiating between them deoending on the darkness or lightness of the colors.</br></br>Another form of color deficiency is blue-yellow. This is a rarer and more severe form of color vision loss than red-green,"
"What causes Colour Blindness?","Usually, color deficiency is an inherited condition caused by a common X-linked recessive gene, which is passed from a mother to her son. But disease or injury that damages the optic nerve or retina can also cause loss of color recognition. Some diseases that can cause color deficits are:</br></br>diabetes</br>glaucoma</br>macular degeneration</br>Alzheimer's disease</br>Parkinson's disease</br>multiple sclerosis</br>chronic alcoholism</br>leukemia</br>sickle cell anemia"
"How is color vision deficiency/color blindness diagnosed?","Color deficiency can be diagnosed through comprehensive eye examination. The patient is shown a series of specially designed pictures composed of colored dots, called pseudoisochromatic plates and asked to look for numbers among the various colored dots. Individuals with normal color vision see a number, while those with a deficiency do not. On some plates, a person with normal color vision sees one number, while a person with a deficiency sees a different number.</br></br>Pseudoisochromatic plate testing can determine if a color vision deficiency exists and the type of deficiency. However, additional testing may be needed to determine the exact nature and degree of deficiency. </br></br>A person could have poor color vision and not know it. Often, people with red-green deficiency aren't aware of their problem because they've learned to see the right color.</br> Early detection of color deficiency is vital since many learning materials rely heavily on color perception or color coding."
"What are the potential eye hazards at work?","Workplace eye protection is needed when the following potential eye hazards are present:</br>Projectiles (dust, concrete, metal, wood and other particles)</br>Chemicals (splashes and fumes)</br>Radiation (especially visible light, ultraviolet radiation, heat or infrared radiation, and lasers)</br>Bloodborne pathogens (hepatitis or HIV) from blood and body fluids</br>Some working conditions include multiple eye hazards. The proper eye protection takes all hazards into account.</br>The type of safety eye protection you should wear depends on the hazards in your workplace:</br>If you are working in an area that has particles, flying objects or dust, you must at least wear safety glasses with side protection (side shields).</br>If you are working with chemicals, you must wear goggles.</br>If you are working near hazardous radiation (welding, lasers or fiber optics) you must use special-purpose safety glasses, goggles, face shields or helmets designed for that task."
"What eye protection Can I wear?","Types of eye protection include:</br>Nonprescription and prescription safety glasses.Safety glasses may look like normal dress eyewear, they are designed to provide significantly more eye protection.</br>Safety glasses provide eye protection for general working conditions where there may be dust, chips or flying particles. </br>Safety lenses are available in plastic, polycarbonate and other materials. While all four types must meet or exceed the minimum requirements for protecting your eyes, polycarbonate lenses provide the highest level of protection from impact.</br>Goggles provide protection from impact, dust and chemical splash.Safety goggles are highly impact-resistant  and can be worn over prescription glasses and contact lenses.</br>Full face shields protect workers exposed to chemicals, heat or blood-borne pathogens. Helmets are used for welding or working with molten materials.</br>Helmets or goggles with special filters to protect the eyes from optical radiation exposure."
"Who is an ophthalmologist?","An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in eye and vision care.and are licensed to practice medicine and surgery."
"What is the difference between an ophthalmologist, orthoptist opticians andoptometrist?","An optometrist is not a medical doctor. They are licensed to practice optometry, which primarily involves performing eye exams and vision tests, prescribing and dispensing corrective lenses, detecting certain eye abnormalities Orthoptists are the experts in diagnosing and treating defects in eye movement and problems with how the eyes work together, called binocular vision. These can be caused by issues with the muscles around the eyes or defects in the nerves enabling the brain to communicate with the eyes. Opticians are technicians trained to design, verify and fit eyeglass lenses and frames, contact lenses, and other devices to correct eyesight. They use prescriptions supplied by ophthalmologists or optometrists"
"How often should I get my eyes checked","If you are 20-39 Years Old</br>you should get a complete eye exam every 2-4 years. </br></br>If you are 20-39 years of age you should get a complete eye exam every 3-5 years. </br></br>40-64 Years Old</br>If you are 40-64 years of age , you should get a complete eye exam every 2-4 years. </br></br>65 Years Old or Older</br>You should get a complete eye exam every 1-2 years.</br></br>People with special risks, such as diabetes, a previous eye trauma, surgery or a family history of glaucoma, may need an eye exam more frequently.</br></br>People with symptoms of eye trouble should see an eye doctor right away."
"How much will my eye exam cost?","The cost of eye exam differs from patient to patient and will depend on the complexity of your condition"
"I have hurt my eye. what should I do","Show a doctor immediately"
"What should I do if I have got chemical in my eye","Flush the eyes out with cool water for at least 15 minutes</br>As you rinse, use your fingers to hold your eye open as wide as possible and roll your eye to ensure the greatest coverage</br>Remove contact lenses, if applicable, if they do not come out during flushing </br>Go to emergency (if you can continue flushing the eye out) flush your eyes out until help arrives"
"What should I do if I feel I have something in my eye","If it feels like something is rubbing against your eyes when you blink it is called a foreign body sensation. Although it could be caused by a particle on the surface of the eyes, the two most common causes are dry eyes, or an inflammation in the eyelids called blepharitis. Other causes include conjunctivitis or other inflammatory conditions of the eye's surface that happen on the eyelids, eyelashes, conjunctiva, episclera, sclera, or cornea. The simplest way to treat this is with artificial tears.</br></br>Other initial treatments include warm compresses with a warm washcloth, or eyelid scrubs with cotton tip applicator and some baby shampoo in warm water.</br></br>Of course if you believe there is actually something in your eye like a foreign particle, then you should have a complete eye exam by an ophthalmologist.</br></br>Also, if your symptoms don't get better after trying these methods, then you should also see an ophthalmologist promptly."
"How much will an eye exam cost","The cost of eye exam differs from patient to patient and will depend on the complexity of your condition"
"How to prevent dry eye","Dry Eye Prevention Tips</br>Try not to use a hair dryer, if possible.</br>Stay away from very warm rooms. In the winter, add moisture to the air with a humidifier. Or put a pan of water near your heater or radiator.</br>Protect your eyes from drying wind by wearing wrap-around glasses outside.</br>Talk to your ophthalmologist about adding omega-3 fatty acids to your diet for dry eye relief. They are found naturally in oily fish (such as salmon, sardines, tuna, trout, and anchovies), and in flaxseeds. Omega-3 fatty acids can be added as a dietary supplement (pill or tablet).</br>Do you wake up with dry and scratchy eyes? Use artificial tear ointment or thick eye drops just before you go to bed."
"How can I prevent pinguecula and pterygium from coming back","The best way to keep pinguecula and pterygium from coming back is to avoid sunlight, dryness and dust."
"How can I reduce the chance of corneal opacity","Prevention</br>To help reduce your chance of corneal opacity:</br></br>Take care to avoid injuring the eye. Wear eye protection during any potentially dangerous activity. Make sure safety goggles are worn tight against the face, otherwise a foreign body can fly up under the goggles and injure the eye.</br>Take proper care of contact lenses. Follow your doctors recommendations regarding wear and cleaning them.</br>Keep your eyes from drying out by using saline eye drops.</br>See your doctor right away if you think you have an eye infection, if you injured your eye, or if you develop any pain or change in vision."
"What should I do if I have cataract","Cataract : Make a decision to get opearted sooner than later. Delays increase the risk of compliactions of Cataract Surgery. Recovery is....."
"What should I do if I have retinal detachment","Retinal detachment is a serious condition. You need repeated visits to the doctor and follow his advice."
"How to prevent vision loss from diabetic retinopathy","Preventing vision loss from diabetic retinopathy If you have diabetes, talk with your primary care doctor about controlling your blood sugar. High blood sugar damages retinal blood vessels. That causes vision loss. Do you have high blood pressure or kidney problems? Ask your doctor about ways to manage and treat these problems. See your ophthalmologist regularly for dilated eye exams. Diabetic retinopathy may be found before you even notice any vision problems. If you notice vision changes in one or both eyes, call your ophthalmologist right away. Get treatment for diabetic retinopathy as soon as possible. This is the best way to prevent vision loss."
"What diet should I take to prevent AMD","Eye-healthy foods</br>Dark leafy greens, yellow fruits and vegetables, fish, and a balanced, nutrient-rich diet have been shown beneficial for people with AMD. Age-related macular degeneration doesn't affect your side (peripheral) vision and usually doesn't cause total blindness. But it can reduce or eliminate your central vision â‚¬â€ which is necessary for driving, reading and recognizing people's faces. It may be beneficial for you to work with a low vision rehabilitation specialist, an occupational therapist, your eye doctor and others trained in low vision rehabilitation. They can help you find ways to adapt to your changing vision."
"What precautions should I take if I have Stye","Stye. Do not squeeze or try to pop a stye or chalazion</br>Doing so could spread the infection into your eyelid. Do not wear eye makeup or contact lenses while you have a stye or chalazion."
"What precautions should I take if I have Ectropion","Ectropion. Wipe your eyes carefully. Constantly wiping watery eyes can make your under-eye muscles and tendons stretch even further, worsening your ectropion. Wipe from the outer eye up and in toward the nose."
"How to relieve pain in Dacryocystitis","Dacryocystitis. To relieve pain and swelling from the infection, hold warm compresses to your eye a few times per day"
"what should I do if I have Endophthalmitis","Endophthalmitis is very rare, but if it occurs, its an urgent medical emergency."
"What should I do if my Uveitis symptoms are reappearing","Uveitis can come back. Make an appointment with your doctor if any of your symptoms reappear after successful treatment."
"How can Strabismus be diagnosed","Strabismus can be diagnosed during a routine eye exam. It is recommended that all children between 3 and 3Â½ years of age have their vision checked by an ophthalmologist.</br></br>If there is a family history of strabismus or amblyopia, or a family history of wearing thick eyeglasses, an ophthalmologist should check vision even earlier than age 3. After a complete eye examination, an ophthalmologist can recommend appropriate treatment."
"How do multifocal cataract lenses work?","With bifocal eyeglasses, you look through the top part of the lens for distance, and through the bottom area of the lens for near. The multifocal lens implant is a specially engineered optic, which provides both, a distance focus, and a near focus. The human brain automatically selects the focus that is appropriate for the task at hand."
"Will multifocal lens eliminate the need for glasses?","For most of the patients, multifocal lens implants will not completely eliminate eyeglasses. There may be situations where the print or the images are too small or too far away to see without the help of glasses."
"Do multifocal lenses eliminate the need for glasses?","For most of the patients, multifocal lens implants will not completely eliminate eyeglasses. There may be situations where the print or the images are too small or too far away to see without the help of glasses."
"Will I see halos?","Depending upon the size of your pupils, you may see linear halos at night, which appear as thin circles within a light source. These halos are different from, and much less problematic than those caused by cataracts. "
"Can multifocal cataract lenses be implanted in just one eye?","Yes, it is possible to implant multifocal cataract lens in just one eye if the other eye already has a standard implant, or if cataract is not present in the other eye."
"Can the multifocal cataract lens be removed if I don't like it?","Yes, it is possible to remove multifocal cataract lens with surgery."
"Can the multifocal cataract lens be removed","Yes, it is possible to remove multifocal cataract lens with surgery."
"Does insurance cover the premium cost to upgrade to multifocal?","Usually, health insurance does not cover the cost to upgrade to multifocal lens. You can always check with your insurance provider to be sure."
"Can I have multifocal cataract lens implants without cataracts?","Yes, patients over the age of 50 years can choose multifocal cataract lens implants to eliminate the need of glasses for both near and far sight. Multifocal cataract lens implants also eliminate the risk of developing cataract at a later age."
"Might I need a LASIK enhancement after a multifocal implant?","The need for LASIK differs from patient to patient and also depends on how much better one wants to see without glasses."
"What type of lens are recommended after cataract surgery","The decision about the type of artificial lens implant to have will have an effect the ability to see without glasses following cataract surgery. With both standard and multifocal lens implants, most people will see reasonably well in the distance without any glasses. Multifocal lens implants generally provides the added ability to read many things without glasses. Please consult your doctor for the recommendation of best suited lens for you."
"Redness in eye","Redness in eye can be caused due to infection, allergies, inflammations like conjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis etc or due to simple dryness."
"Red Eye","Redness in eye can be caused due to infection, allergies, inflammations like conjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis etc or due to simple dryness."
"minus refractive error","This is known as myopia. It can be treated with glasses, contact lenses and with refrative surgeries."
"Minus number","This is known as myopia. It can be treated with glasses, contact lenses and with refrative surgeries."
"plus refractive error","This is known as hypermetropia, it can be treated with glasses, contact lenses and with refractive error surgeries"
"plus number","This is known as hypermetropia, it can be treated with glasses, contact lenses and with refractive error surgeries"
"Astigmatism","This is also known as cylindrical refractive error, it can be in both minus and plus forms. It can be treated with glasses, toric contact lenses and with refractive error surgeries."
"Presbyopia","When we get near number around the age of 40 years, it is known as Presbyopia. It can be treated with glasses and contact lenses."
"watering of the eye","Watering of the eyes can be due to dryness, change in refractive errors, digital eye strain or blocked tear glands"
"watery eyes","Watering of the eyes can be due to dryness, change in refractive errors, digital eye strain or blocked tear glands"
"itching of the eye","Itching of the eyes can be due to allergies or infections"
"Itchy eyes","Itching of the eyes can be due to allergies or infections"
"eye pain","Eye pain can be because of uncorrected refractive error, sinusitis, raised intra ocular pressure(IOP), eye fatigue"
"Painful eye","Eye pain can be because of uncorrected refractive error, sinusitis, raised intra ocular pressure(IOP), eye fatigue"
"Pain in the eye","Eye pain can be because of uncorrected refractive error, sinusitis, raised intra ocular pressure(IOP), eye fatigue"
"eye injury","In case of eye injury, visit your nearest ophthalmologist immediately"
"Injury in the eye","In case of eye injury, visit your nearest ophthalmologist immediately"
"Headache","Headache is not always eye related. It can be because of certain eye related things such as change in refractive errors, eye muscle inabilities to focus enough on near and far things."
"distorted images","Distorted images can be a retinal problem and need to be ruled out at hospital with dilated eye examination."
"What is an intraocular lens (IOL)","With intraocular simply meaning, inside the eye, an IOL is an artificial lens used to replace the natural lens of your eye. In cataract surgery, the surgeon will remove the cloudy lens affected by the cataracts and replace it with a clear IOL that should last you for the rest of your life. An IOL may also be implanted before cataracts emerge, to correct refractive errors."
"What is a trifocal lens","A trifocal lens is a type of IOL designed to improve vision at near, intermediate and far distances. This is different from monofocal or bifocal lenses, which correct vision at only one or two focal points. Because of this, trifocal lenses can be implanted to address vision problems such as presbyopia, with or without astigmatism."
"What are the benefits of a PanOptixÂ IOL","The PanOptix IOL is different from other IOLs, because it has been designed to provide optimal intermediate vision, on top of near and distance ranges. This is because other trifocal IOLs work best at an intermediate range of 80cm, whereas PanOptix IOL trifocal lens is optimised for 60 cm, which has been demonstrated to be a more natural working distance based on the average persons arm length. This can help patients perform daily intermediate tasks, like using a computer, with no glasses."
"Are there other kinds of IOL available to me","Yes, there are other types of IOL available and you should discuss the best option for you with your eye doctor."
"Can the PanOptix lens be used to address presbyopia","Yes. As the PanOptix Lens is designed to improve vision at all distances, it can mitigate presbyopia, a common condition that makes it difficult to see up close. Addressing presbyopia provides an opportunity to reduce or even eliminate your need to wear reading glasses."
"Can the PanOptix lens be used to correct astigmatism","Yes, the PanOptix Lens is available in a toric option to correct astigmatism. Toric lenses sharpen vision and clear the distortion caused by astigmatism. They may even help free you from glasses and contacts for distance vision. Discuss with your eye doctor whether this is the right choice for your vision goals. "
"How does the PanOptix IOL treat cataracts","During cataract surgery, an eye surgeon removes the cloudy natural lens from your eye(s) and replaces it with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL). Once the new lens is in place, your vision should be sharper and clearer within a few weeks and the IOL should last you for the rest of your life."
"What is SmILE","It is an acronym standing forÂ SmallÂ IincisionÂ LenticuleÂ Extraction (Â SmILEÂ )- is a minimally invasive and innovative procedure. Instead of the laser ablation of the cornea, only minimal amount is lasered to create a lenticule which is then extracted through a keyhole corneal incision (compare 2-4 mm to 20 mm used in LASIK)."
"What is ReLEx","It is an acronym standing for-Â RefractiveÂ LenticuleÂ Extraction (ReLEx)- is a novel refractive surgery and the most recent, advanced laser vision correction procedure in the world. Many surgeons believe that this All-femto laser vision correction is the technique of the future."
"What is the recovery time of this laser eye procedure","It is said that the actual recovery (physical tissue recovery) from Relex smile is quicker. This is because there is noÂ cutÂ orÂ flapÂ made. The small incision through which the lenticule is removedÂ heals very quickly, by end of the day or next. And as there is no risk of flap related issues, one can resume activities like swimming, outdoor sports etc within the first week itself post smile procedures. In LASIK such energetic activities are usually allowed after 15 days to a month.Â "
"How safe is the procedure","Very safe. The entire idea which conceptualized SmILE is based on how to make laser procedures that exist today, such as LASIK, even safer and more stable in the long term. This technique is not only effective and predictable but also provides a safety and stability that is superior to traditional LASIK. it is free from flap related complications possible with other forms of LASIK. The cornea is biomechanically more stable after ReLEx SmILE as the incision made on the cornea is 80% smaller than the flap cut made during conventional LASIK, minimizing the chances of late corneal thinning and ectasia and also dry eye."
"Can all refractive errors be corrected with ReLEx SMILE","ReLEx SmILE can correctÂ MyopiaÂ andÂ Astigmatism.Â Hypermetropia (Plus Power)Â andÂ PresbyopiaÂ cannot be corrected with this procedure."
"Why do we need SMILE when other procedures are doing fine","SmILE is FLAPLESS. No flap means</br>No complications</br>No weak cornea</br>Less Dry eye</br>No nerves are cut"
"Is there any age limit for SMILE ReLEx LASER treatment","It can be done above 18 yrs up to 40 years. However, eligibility has to be determined through a series of tests."
"Am I a suitable candidate for ReLEx SmILE","Most of the patients suitable for conventional LASIK can also be treated with ReLEx SmILE. You have to consult our ophthalmologist, Dr Anand Shroff for a detailed examination."
"Why do patients prefer SMILE","If there are any complications in LASIK, then 99% of them are due to flap. Since SmILE has no flap, there are no flap related complications."
"Why is smile said to be Ultra-gentle on the eyesÂ ","The opening needed to extract the lenticule is far smaller than the previous and older method [80% less than in LASIK] therefore the structure of the cornea remains more intact. The contact glass through which the laser beams pass, adapts to the curve of the cornea, making this procedureÂ painless."
"Is SMILE accurate","YES. It is not just highly accurate but also highly predictable. There is no tissue distortion. Comparison studies with LASIK show better results."
"What about Dry eye issues","As the number of corneal nerves affected during the procedure is far lower than that in LASIK, the resulting dry eye symptoms are significantly lesser or near zero in patients undergoing ReLEx SmILE."
"Which laser has more chances of ectasia","ReLEX SmILE was born to address the problem of ectasia which came from LASIK. So any laser eye surgery which has aÂ flap has higher chances of ectasia. Hence, SmILEÂ is safer with very veryÂ low chances of ectasia,Â near zero."
"my eyes are red","Redness in eye can be caused due to infection, allergies, inflammations like conjunctivitis, iritis, scleritis etc or due to simple dryness."

The advanced technology offers surgeons a precise, detailed mapping of the cornea which allows for customized care for each eye of each patient. More than 22,000 unique elevation points on the cornea are analyzed and sent to the surgical planning computer, which directs the laser beam to correct the minute variations of curvature at each point."
"lensar","The LENSAR Laser System is the only femtosecond cataract laser built specifically for refractive cataract surgery. Because it was designed from the ground up, every aspect of the laser has been purposefully designed to meet the needs of cataract surgeons."
"Can I get new glasses if I have bubble after retina surgery?","Following a vitrectomy or pneumatic retinopexy, it is recommended to wait until a gas bubble clears from the eye before getting a new eyeglasses prescription to ensure you get the correct prescription. Waiting for the gas to clear also allows your retina time to heal and for vision to recover from surgery. If it is an emergency (such as your current pair breaks), then it is fine to proceed with a new prescription."
"Can dry eyes cause double vision, especially when tired?","Yes. Double vision can happen when the brain gets two different images either from each eye or from within the same eye. While double vision is not the most common symptom of dry eye syndrome, the drier the eyes are, the fuzzier the image is. Sometimes this happens when a patient has subtle eye misalignment, but with the additional blur from dry eyes, now they notice their double vision. This can also be worsened with fatigue, which can affect the eye muscles."
"I've been diagnosed with calcium deposits behind my eyes. What causes this and what is the treatment, if any?","It is likely you have optic nerve head drusen, which are calcified lesions that sit directly in front of the optic nerve, which enters in the back of the eye. Optic nerve head drusen often form spontaneously, but can also be inherited. No treatment is necessary, as they typically remain asymptomatic. Very rarely they may cause changes in the eye that can cause vision loss, however this is extremely uncommon."
"Im experiencing intense itching mostly on the lower inner lid of one eye. This has been going on for about a month. What could it be?","Itching is commonly associated with allergies. Allergic itching can be effectively treated with over-the-counter eye drops or pills.

"What is Lasik","It is an outpatient surgical procedure used to treat near sightedness(myopia), farsightedness(hypermetropia) and astimagtism to get normal vision. In Lasik, laser is used to reshape the cornea, which is located at the front of the eye and the eye can properly focus the light rays on the retina at the back for better vision"
"How laser works","The laser excimer laser is used to chnage the shape of the cornea by selective tissue ablation(removal) and surface polishing, reslting in chanfing of the focusing pwer of eye and eliminate the refractive error of the eye</br>A hinged flap is created using the top layer of your cornea</br>An FDA approved laser reshapes you cornea to correct your vision</br>The flap is folded back over your cornea</br>Excimer laser is used in laser vision correction procedure. it is cold , safe and superficial laser which causes little damage to the cornea"
"What is lasik procedure","Eye is made numb with a few drops of tropical anesthesia</br>The patient is reclined under a excimer/laik machine</br>An eyelid speculum is placed between the eyelids to keep them open</br>A suction ring is placed on the eye which lifts and flattens the cornea 
and prevents the eye form moving</br>Microkeratome balde or fematolaser is used to create a hinged flap of paper-thin
corneal issue</br>The corenal flap is lifted and folded back</br>The laser sculpts the exposed corenal tissue, which is pre-programmed with the
measurement of your eye</br>This flap is replaced in position and the edges are smoother</br>Vision is restored in a few minutes and you cna get abck to your work shortly without glasses
"
"What is PRK and Lasek","Both these procedures are less popular, casue pain and gave slower visual recovery than lasik, but some patients are more benefitted from these procedure and it is recommended for such patients</br>Ask the doctor or our center for further information and advise,which procedure is appropirate for you</br>Step 1: Alongsde numbing drops, an alcohal solution is placed on the eye to help soften the cornea</br>Step 2: The surgeon then smooths the surface of the cornea with a special surgical instrument</br>Step 3: An excimer laser is then used to precisely reshape the curvature of the cornea's surface</br>Step 4: A bandage-like soft contact lense is then palced on the cornea to help protect the eye it heals"
"Whatr are the available LASIK options","Available various LASIK options are as below:</br>1) Conventional / Standard Lasik :- It only removes the refractory error or your glass power and causes night vision difficulties such as glare and halocs.</br>2) Topolink :- In this procedure, Laser uses topographic map of cornea and causes minimal changes in the shape of cornea. After this procedure, Patient feels negligible amount of night vision difficulties. .</br>3) Wavefront-Guided customized Lasik :- This procedure gives customize treatment treatment for individual eye by removing lower order aberration (Sphere and cylinder) higher order aberrations (Coma and tefoil) and also cause minimal change in the shape of cornea, hence giving excellent vision in low contrast and night conditions. Sometimes it gives more than normal vision, ever seen before."

"What is LENS","The Lens is a clear part of the eye that focus light, or  an image on the rena. (In a normal eye, once the  light reaches the rena, it is changed into nerve  signals that are sent to the brain) </br>If the Len is cloudy from a cataract , the image received by the rena will be blurred."
"What causes cataract","Most cataract are related to aging, cataract are very common in older people</br>Cataract also occcur due to</br>1) Genetic Inheritence </br>2) Eye injuries and eye surgeries</br>3)Dieseases like diabetes,kindney diseases etc.</br>4)Prolonged use of certain medications like steriods"
"Who is at risk for cataract","People with increasing age, diseases like diabetes, kidney diseases, habits of smoking and prolonged exposure to ultraviolet sunlight are at more risk of cataract"
"When are you most likely to have a cataract","People can have an age-related cataract in their 40s and 50s, but during middle age,  most cataracts are small and do not affect vision, over the age 60 light passing through the lens  gets reduced upto 50%, and that cause problem with a persons vision. If the cataract  interferes with your regular acvies, one can go for surgery."
"What are the different types of cataract","Different type of cataract are as follows:</br>1)Secondary Cataract - Â Cataract occur after surgery for other eye problems such asÂ glaucoma, retina surgery, after diseases like diabetes or prolonged use of steroid</br> 2)Traumatic Cataract </br> 3) Congenital Cataract : Some babies are born with cataract or develop them in childhood, often in both eyes, these cataract are to small that they do not affect vision, if they do, the lenses may need to be removed</br>4) Radiation Cataract"

"What happens before cataract surgery"," It is important to check-up your eyes to establish the diagnosis and to rule out other eye associated eye conditions</br> Your doctor will do some tests before surgery which include measuring the curvature and size and shape of your eye, this information will help to choose the right Intraocular Lens (IOL) to restore your Vision.</br> Your doctor may ask for complete retinal examination before surgery if needed</br> A thorough physical examination by physician to rule out diabetes, hypertension, Asthma, Heart & Rental problems, Chest Diseases or Drug allergies, If it needed by ophthalmologist and alert anaesthetist to these medical risks."
"What happens during cataract surgery"," You may be asked not to eat or drink before your surgery.</br>At the hospital, drops will be put into your eye to dilate the pupil one hour before the surgery, and other drops are put 5 minutes before and during surgery to numb your eye. </br>The operation usually lasts less than one hour and is almost painless.</br>You will see bright light and hear different sounds of phaco machine during the  surgery but dont be afraid of this. </br>After the operation a patch is placed over your eye, rest for a while and then can go  home same day. You will need someone to drive home. "
"What happens after cataract surgery","You will have some itching, mild discomfort and fluid discharge after Cataract Surgery.</br>You may feel some bright light and slight pain while touch your eye after surgery, which will disappear after few days. </br>For few weeks after surgery, your doctor may ask you to use few drops to help healing and  decrease the risk of infection.</br>You will have to use eyeglasses to protect your eye from dust, wind and bright light.</br>Just avoid rubbing or pressing your eye, bending from waist or lifting heavy objects</br>You can walk, climb stairs and do light house hold work.</br> In most cases, healing will be completed within six to eight weeks and your vision should be improved to normal, however you may require glasses for fine vision."
" What are the risks and problems of Cataract Surgery","As with any surgery, Cataract surgery poses risks, such as infection and bleeding, your doctor may ask you to stop some medication help to prevent bleeding during surgery. You must keep your eye clean, wash your hands before touching your eyes and to use prescribe medication drops to minimise the risk of function</br> Retinal detachment, corneal damage and nucleus drop are the some rarely occurring sight threatening complication however optimal outcome can be achieved by  timely and proper management.</br> 99% success rate can be achieved now a days after present modern cataract surgery and person can have even more than normal vision as ever before."
"What can I do to protect my vision","Wearing Sunglasses and a hat to block ultraviolet sunlight which will delay the Cataract.</br> Studies highlighted, to have good nutrition and  quit smoking reduce the rate of age related cataract formation.</br> After the age of 60 years, you should have dilated eye examination every two years to check for the signs of age related macular degeneration, Glaucoma and other vision disorders along with Cataract."
"What type of lens material are used in eye","Mainly two types of lens materials are used in eye</br>1)Silicone - Made up of Poly Dimethyl Siloxane</br>2) PMMA (Poly Methyl Metha Acrylate) "
"Wha are the types of acrylic lenses","PMMA (Poly Methyl Metha Acrylate) - If the Acrylic Co-polymer material used in manufacturing of IOL (lens) having temperature below glass transition temperature than it has rigid properties, and so called as rigid acrylic IOLs .</br> Foldable Acrylic IOLs :- The temperature of co-polymer is above glass transition temperature than it has flexible properties, and called Foldable Acryclic IOLs</br> Hydrophilic Acrylic IOLs (Hydrogels) :- If foldable Acrylic Co-polymer having high water content of about 18 to 38 percent than it becomes Hydrophilic Acrylic IOLs. It has refractive index of 1.47 which makes it thinner makes it thinner than silicone(1.41) lenses</br> These lenses are associated with higher rate of reaction and PCO due to its low uveal and capsular biocompatibility</br> Hydrophobic Acrylic IOLs :- If foldable acrylic co polymers having lower water content of about 1 percent than it becomes hydrophobic Acrylic IOLs."
"What is glistening","Glistening - these are fluid filled microvacuoles in the IOL optic which is surrounded by aqueous environment in the eye.</br> These lenses are associated with higher rate of glistening however it can be reduced by increasing the refractive index (1.54) and water content 4% of acryclic material"

"What are Hydrophobic Acrylic IOLs ","If foldable acrylic co polymers having lower water content of about 1 percent than it becomes hydrophobic Acrylic IOLs.</br>These lenses are associated with lesser rate of reaction and PCO formation due to its higher uveal and capsular biocompatibility"
"What are spherical IOLs","The human eyes Natural lens is aspheric (not spherical).</br>Spherical IOLs have spherical optical design in which the front/anterior surface of IOL is uniformly curved from the center of lens to its periphery. This design does not mimic the shape of natural human lens inside the eye.</br>A Spherical Intraocular lens can induce minor optical imperfections called higher order aberrations (HOA), which can affect quality of vision, particularly in low light condition such as driving at night or working in evening or low light."
"What is aspheric IOLs","Aspheric IOLs because of its special design and prolate anterior surface match more closely the shape and optical quality of human eyes natural 
lens, they can provide sharper vision especially in low light condition and for people with large pupils which is also approved by USFDA"
"What is presbyopia","Around the age of 40, the natural human lens of eye begins to harden and become less flexible, which reduce from near, far inbetween and back again."
"What are the signs of presbyopia","Loss of ability to read.</br> Difficulty in viewing a computer screen.</br> Holding objects farther away to read.</br> Holding objects farther away to read"
"What are the type of lenses","Cataracts are removed during the surgery and replace with an Intraocular Lens.</br> There are different types of Lenses (IOLs) available.</br> (A) Monofocal Lens (IOLs):- Lens that treat only cataracts are called Monofocal Lenses. These lenses provide good distance vision but require reading glasses to see up close.</br> (B) Multificoal Lens (IOLs):- The Lens that treat cataract as well as Presbyopia are called Multifocal Lens. These Lenses provide full range of vision for distance - for viewing computer screen and near - for viewing mobile phone</br> (C) Toric Lenses (IOLs):- The lens that treat cataracts, as well as astigmatism are called Toric Lens.

"What is Astigmatism","Normally, Cornea is round in shape, like a baseball. Astigmatism occurs when the cornea is shape more like an egg or american baseball. When light passes through a cornea with astigmatism the image doesn't focus sharply on the retina causing blurred vision."
"What causes astigmatism","The cause of Astigmatism is not known, It may be present since birth as may also result post eye surgery or trauma"
"Who are the candidates for Toric IOL Surgery","Candidates for Toric IOL surgery are as  below:</br>Have greater than or equal to 1.0 D astigmatism</br> Present preoperative regular astigmatism</br> Have an intact capsular bag</br> Have had no previous refractive surgery</br> Have no prexisting ocular pathology</br> Desire improve distance with less dependence on glass"
"How can an Intraocular Lens (IOL) correct both Astigmatism and cataract","Standard Monofocal or Multifocal IOLs can improve vision by replacing cataractous natural lens of the eye but need glasses or contact lens to correct astigmatism.</br> Toric IOLs , like monofocal or multifocal IOLs replace eyes cataractous lens but also help to correct astigmatism at the same time.</br> Special Techniques and preoperative examination are done to find the amount and axis of astigmatis.</br> The Toric IOLs have marking of axis on their anterior surface which should be aligned during the surgery with pre-operative marking placed over cornea at the axis of astigmatism thereby neutralising the amount of corneal astigmatism with toril IOLs"
"Can I get my cataract surgery done during the summers or rainy season?","Cataract or other surgeries on the eye can be performed at any time of the year. The weather conditions (heat or humidity or excessive cold) have no effect whatsoever on the outcome or performance of the surgical procedure."
"My cataract has not matured yet. Should I be considering surgery at the moment?","Cataract surgery can be performed anytime when it causes difficulty in vision. The concept of a cataract reaching the stage of maturity (or becoming ripe) is a very old one, and dates back about thirty years to the 1980s when surgery used to be performed manually with large incisions, and required stitches. In present times, cataract surgery is generally stitch-less. It is actually best to get a cataract operated before the stage of maturity.  The surgery at this stage is easier to perform, and much less likely to cause complications."
"I got my left eye operated for cataract last week, and since then have been sitting in a dark room away from light. For how much more time do I need to avoid light?","Visible light does not harm the eyes after cataract surgery. One can sit in a normally lit room, and even watch television and use computers. Dark glasses after surgery are usually meant for protection against dust and injury."
"Iâ€™m a thirty-year-old woman and wear spectacles since the last 15 years. My spectacle number is -3. Can I get rid of my number by eating healthy food, or with medicines?","It is not possible to reduce or eliminate ones refractive error (â€œnumberâ€) by any dietary supplement or medicines. Green leafy vegetables, carrots and other food products are otherwise healthy for your eyes, but they do not help in reducing the number. It can only be removed or reduced by refractive surgery like LASIK."
"I have a twelve-year-old daughter who wears spectacles since the last four years. Her number has changed twice. What can I do to make sure that it does not change again?","Children usually grow physically till the age of 18-19 years. Physical growth of the body is accompanied by growth of the eyes, and this is responsible for a change in number of spectacles. It is, therefore, not possible to stop the number from changing. However, in most people, it stabilizes by 18 or 19 years of age."
"Iâ€™m a diabetic patient since the last ten years. Is it possible for me to undergo cataract surgery?","Yes, diabetic patients can safely undergo cataract surgery provided the blood sugar levels are under control."
"My diabetes is well under control with medicines and exercise. Can my eyes still get affected by diabetes?","Diabetes can affect the retina of the eyes, causing what is technically known as Diabetic Retinopathy. It can happen with well-controlled sugar levels as well. So regular check-ups, especially for the retina, are mandatory for all diabetics."
"I work on my laptop for 8 to 10 hours a day. What can do to prevent it from reducing my eyesight?","Excessive use of computers does not reduce oneâ€™s eyesight. It can merely cause problems like dryness of eyes, redness, watering, eyestrain or headaches (Computer Vision Syndrome). To avoid such issues, maintain a proper distance from the screen, use a comfortable level of brightness, take short breaks while working for long periods, and maintain a good posture."
" My father lost his eyesight a couple of years ago due to glaucoma. Can an eye transplant restore his vision?","An eye transplant principally refers to a corneal transplant, where the front part of the eye, the cornea, is replaced. The entire eye is never transplanted/replaced. So this is helpful only when vision is affected by corneal disease. Eyesight once lost due to glaucoma cannot be restored."
"Iâ€™m a perfectly healthy individual with no problems with my eyesight. Do I still need regular eye checkups?","Many conditions that affect the eye, like glaucoma, have no symptoms at all, and are detected incidentally on routine examination. Regular eye checkups help to diagnose such problems early, so that adequate treatment measures can be taken timely, which may help minimize loss of vision."
"My brother recently developed â€œeye-fluâ€. Will the infection spread to me if I look directly into his eyes?","An â€œeye-fluâ€, technically termed â€œConjunctivitisâ€ is an infection of the outer part of the eye, the Conjunctiva. Infection usually spreads by infected discharge, through dirty hands, handkerchiefs or other objects, through touch. Looking at an infected eye does not spread the infection."
"Does sitting close to the television damage oneâ€™s eyesight?","Sitting at a very close distance to the television set may cause eyestrain and headache, but is not known to damage the eyes or cause deterioration of vision. Sitting close and watching, however, may be a symptom of myopia or near-sightedness."

"how to clean my eyes","To clean your eyes, refrain from rubbing them and use a warm compress for relief and removal of debris. If necessary, a doctor-approved cleaning method or saline solution can be used. Over-the-counter eye drops can also help keep eyes clean and moisturized. Regularly clean eyewear to avoid irritation. Good hand hygiene can prevent eye infections. If your eyes are frequently irritated or red, seek professional care. Never try to remove foreign objects from your eyes by yourself; always seek medical attention."
