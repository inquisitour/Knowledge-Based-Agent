** Improvement possibilities for EmbeddingRetriever **

1. Improve the Embedding Model [DONE]
The choice of embedding model has a significant impact on the quality of the semantic search. We were previously using "text-embedding-ada-002" from OpenAI, which is a decent model but might not capture the nuances of medical or technical queries.
Upgrade to a More Powerful Model: Models like "text-embedding-3-large" or "text-embedding-3-small" may provide more accurate embeddings due to their larger scale and training data.

2. Improve Similarity Calculation [DONE]
Refining how similarity is calculated can also affect the relevance of results.
Adjust the Similarity Threshold: Along with the top k results, using results which are above a certain similarity score threshold to ensure relevance.

3. Refine Query and Document Processing
Proper preprocessing of both the query and the document texts can enhance the accuracy of semantic matches.
Enhanced Preprocessing: Include steps like lemmatization, removal of stop words, and handling of synonyms. For medical queries, consider using specialized NLP tools that understand medical terminology.

4. Use of Advanced Retrieval Techniques
Beyond simple vector searches, more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms can be employed.
Hybrid Retrieval Systems: Combine keyword search with vector search to narrow down the candidate pool before vector similarity scoring.

5. Feedback Loop
Implementing a feedback mechanism where the system learns from past queries and their relevance assessments can continually improve the accuracy.
Active Learning: Use user feedback on the relevance of returned answers to fine-tune the embeddings or the retrieval process and adjust the ranking based on which answers users find most helpful.
