** Improvement possibilities for multi-agent setup**

1. Introduce DBopsAgent
The DBopsAgent serves as a specialized component within a larger system, focused entirely on database operations. It encapsulates all direct interactions with the database, such as retrieving, inserting, and updating data. This agent is built on top of the DBops class, which includes methods for various database tasks leveraging the Python database connectivity and operations. By abstracting these operations into a dedicated agent, the system enhances separation of concerns, allowing for more secure and manageable database interactions.

2. Introduce RetrieverAgent
The RetrieverAgent is designed to handle the retrieval of information from a database or other storage system using natural language processing (NLP) tools and embeddings. It processes queries, converts them into a form suitable for retrieval, and then fetches the relevant information. This agent typically integrates machine learning models, such as those provided by OpenAI, to embed queries and compare them with stored data embeddings to find the most relevant matches. This functionality is crucial for systems requiring dynamic data retrieval based on user queries.

3. Introduce both as Langchain tools
In LangChain, both DBopsAgent and RetrieverAgent can be encapsulated as Tool objects. LangChain's tooling system allows agents to leverage specialized functions through a unified interface. Each tool is configured with specific functionalities—DBopsAgent for database operations and RetrieverAgent for data retrieval—making them callable within the broader agent framework. This setup facilitates the modular assembly of complex systems where each component can be independently developed, tested, and maintained.

4. Introduce PrimeAgent as a parent agent
The PrimeAgent acts as the parent agent in a system composed of multiple specialized agents like DBopsAgent and RetrieverAgent. This parent agent coordinates the actions of its sub-agents, directing queries to the appropriate agent based on the task requirements. It manages the flow of information between sub-agents and ensures that the responses from various tools are integrated into a coherent output. The PrimeAgent can also handle tasks that do not fall specifically within the purview of its sub-agents, providing a flexible and scalable solution for complex systems.

5. Restructure the code
To restructure the code to include these agents and their interactions within a LangChain framework:
Define Tool Wrappers: Wrap the functionalities of DBopsAgent and RetrieverAgent into LangChain tools. This involves defining each method in these agents as callable functions within the Tool configuration.
Initialize Sub-agents: Create instances of DBopsAgent and RetrieverAgent within the PrimeAgent. This setup allows the PrimeAgent to call on these sub-agents when their specific functionalities are required.
Agent Coordination: Implement logic in PrimeAgent to handle input queries and determine which sub-agent should handle the query. This might involve simple conditional logic or more complex decision-making processes based on the content of the queries.
Unified Response Handling: Ensure that responses from sub-agents are aggregated or selected appropriately by PrimeAgent to form a final response to the user or system that initiated the query.
