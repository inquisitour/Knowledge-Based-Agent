Some people find it helpful to focus on a specific point on the ceiling.</br>Use one hand to pull your lower eyelid down, away from the eye. This forms a pocket to catch the drop.</br>Hold the dropper tip directly over the eyelid pocket.</br>Squeeze the bottle gently and let the eye drop fall into the pocket.</br>Dont touch the bottle to your eye or eyelid. This can give bacteria or other contaminants a chance to grow in your eye drops.</br>After Youve Put in Eye Drops:</br>Close your eyes and do not blink.</br>Apply gentle pressure to your tear ducts, where the eyelid meets the nose.</br>Hold the tear ducts closed for a minute or two\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dor as long as your ophthalmologist recommends\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dbefore opening your eyes.

When the drops are cold it might be easier to feel the drop when it hits the eye, so you can tell where it has landed.</br>If you have a lot of trouble putting in your eye drops, ask a caregiver or family member to help.</br>": 0.4067864558046458,
