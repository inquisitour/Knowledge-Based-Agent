1) question-answer pair save (post)
2) data hash
3) In next initialisation question-answer pairs with their embeddings will be saved in postgres
4) using category column, build knowledge graph and save embeddings in NEo4j
5) postgres + neo4j + user_question --> response
6) Repeat


text embeddings + graph embeddings + user query = common embeddings
